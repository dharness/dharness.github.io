        <p class="blog-text">A Very Vaccuum Birthday was our first attempt at making an animation in toonboom. 
        We gave ourselves a week to write the script, storyboard and ship a fully animated video.
        We used Fiver for the voice-over work. Unfortunately, we did not get to the ink and colour before the deadline. 
        Co-created with Dylan Harness.
