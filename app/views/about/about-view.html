      <h4>On the meaning of Grand</h4>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="large-6 columns">
          <p>Grand, in the sense of magnificent - in the sense of astonishing - in the sense that it's scale is larger than life. I strive to always seek out opporunities which posses this quality and weed out ones that don't. This is an iterative process - but my first of the 2 tenets of my personal mission will never be fulfilled with the mundane, the banal, the hum-drum, 9-5, normal, complacent or tepid.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="large-6 columns">
          <p>I actualize this tenet by aiming for high impact, high volume forms of art. Through the use of Software, Digital Media, Music and Education I strive to change the world. I am a firm believer that education is the corner-stone of success - but an heretical skeptic that <i>the education system </i>is the coner-stone of education. This is one way in which I intend to reach a global audience.</p>

      <h4>On the meaning of Beautiful</h4>
      
      <p>Beauty for me comes in many forms. It can be poems that move you, a UI that feels like home, or a real world event that brings you to tears. The most important thing I keep in my mind when striving to make my art - is that it is uncesored, unfiltered, and raw.</p>
      
      <p>I make things of beauty every day in mediums both classical and modern. I write poems, songs, software, prose, and try to inject a beautiful art into every day things like conversations with people. I am forever on the journey to making my most beautiful piece, my manifesto, and when I do - I will probably blog about it.</p>
